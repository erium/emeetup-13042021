# RESTful APIs - Example

This is the example code + slides of the Erium Data Science Meetup held by @int32at on 13-04-2021. The example contains a very basic `Flask` + `Swagger` setup that demonstrates how to create a `REST` API very quickly and document it well.

## Requirements
1. Docker + docker-compose

## Installation / Running
```bash
docker-compose up
```

After the building is done, open 

- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:5000/api/docs`
- Swagger Spec: `http://localhost:5000/api/spec`
- Person API: `http://localhost:5000/api/persons/123`
